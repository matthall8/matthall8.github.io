          <h2>Is today's education system fit for purpose?</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.</p>
            <p> - Martin Luther King</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Education is incredible. This is something surely everyone agrees with. We make it compulsory for children, from ages 4 until 18. People pay thousands and thousands of pounds to continue in it. Speak to the majority of &quot;Successful&quot; people and they will attribute their achievements to it. But are we doing it right? Are we wasting billions of pounds on it?</p>
          <p>In an era where computers are capable of doing repetitive tasks quicker and more efficient than humans, many argue creativity is vital. But are schools teaching the right things to get people ready for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Worse still, are schools killing the creativity of our population? This is something Sir Ken Robinson argues in his influential TED talk:</p>

          <h2>The education system of tomorrow</h2>
          <p>My view is that schools are not doing a good enough job of enabling the potential of our youth today. In order to see progress, I would like to see the following three things implemented:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Coding classes for all children through primary and secondary school</li>
            <li>Personalisation in the classroom that allows children to learn in the best way for them - be it visual, audio or text</li>
            <li>More emphasis on creativity rather than memorising facts</li>
          </ol>
          <p>There is still plenty to do for schools however beginning with these 3 elements would be a good start towards allowing schools to become as engaging as we all know they can be.</p>
